This repository documents all of the code used for ME35's Final Project. 
Refer here to an in-depth discussion of the Project and its goals 

File descriptions: 
cv.py - Performs image processing to locate the bone and second the inverse 
kinematics (angles) to the Hub
lego.py - Listens for angles and moves the motors to those angels to pickup the
bone
BLE_CEEO.py - The bluetooth used in lego.py 

Libraries used: 
OpenCV - for image processing 
BLE_CEEO - for bluetooth communication (running on the Hub)
Bleak - for bluetooth communication (running on the Mac)
The Spike PRIME coding library
